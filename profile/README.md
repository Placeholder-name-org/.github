### Overview
An AI-powered fintech platform designed to help Brazilian middle-class investors safely enter the stock market through intelligent, automated portfolio management. Our solution addresses the common barriers that prevent everyday Brazilians from investing: lack of time to study economics, fear of investment scams, and inadequate returns from traditional investment methods like INSS, Renda Fixa, and Poupança.

The platform features a custom AI model trained on economic literature and B3 historical data, focusing on security-first investment strategies rather than raw growth, which can be dangerous some times. Our AI analyzes market patterns, manages portfolio rebalancing, and provides insights while maintaining transparency in all investment decisions.

This project is being developed as our Final Paper for the Systems Development course at [Colégio Técnico de Limeira](https://www.cotil.unicamp.br/) - [UNICAMP](https://unicamp.br/), by [@heitorrosa](https://github.com/heitorrosa), [@gomesdevs](https://github.com/gomesdevs), [@PCarniello](https://github.com/PCarniello) and [@PedroHCiolfi](https://github.com/PedroHCiolfi).
